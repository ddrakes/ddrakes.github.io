Not growing up with much I've always wanted to be "successful". So, I took the traditional route. Graduated high school, went off to college, and as society puts it you should be pretty much set. I understand it takes work researching the right degree and career path in order to reach that comfortability we all search for. Even a step further networking and preparing yourself for the process of interning, applying to different positions, getting the interview, and eventually the offer of your dream job. Oh, and I almost forgot actually going to class. That went almost as planned for myself. Let me tell you a little bit about my journey so far. 
 
My junior year at a career fair I met a project management for a construction company. He told me all about the duties, the career path I should take, and all about the career path itself. At that moment I decided I was going to be a project manager. I got accepted to the Arizona State University construction program and I was really excited, more so, because it was a D1 school and known for its parties. At that time in my life it was also important to me to get the full college experience and to me that was good sports and parties! My freshman year was great! After a couple of weeks being in Arizona I was hired as a leasing agent from a brand new apartment complex being built. I told them about my construction interest and I was able to tour the site which it was being built. I joined a fraternity, got involved in leadership, had opportunities to travel to California for conferences, went to football games, saw James Harden play in college since he went to ASU what more could I have asked for!? As for the grades and academic experience, not so great. 
 
My first semester I got like a 3.0 but second semester it went down hill. I can't remember exactly and I'm not going to look it up but let's just say it was much, much lower. I was upset with myself and thought about going back to my home state New Jersey. After reaching out to the fraternity president he assured me not to be worried. It's a learning experience for everyone and he was even in my shoes his freshman year being an engineering major so I decided to stick it out. This first year I also realized construction sucked. The classes were super boring, I was reading about concrete all the time, most of the kids in the class had construction backgrounds, I felt really out of place. So, I changed majors, 
 
Going back to that junior year career fair I stayed in contact with the project manager I had met for the remainder of college and throughout college (networking 101)! He told me I necessarily didn't need a construction degree and project management was more about relationships, communication, and business. So, I changed my major to [Interdisciplinary Studies](https://cisa.asu.edu/undergrad/proginfo/interdisciplinary-studieshttp://) with concentrations in business and psychology with a minor in urban planning. During my sophomore year I went to the career office all the time and was preparing for a interview with the company I met with back in high school for a project management internship. I was there so much my picture was in the career office and they even used it for career fairs.

The interview was going great until they asked me "What made you decide to add on the Urban Planning minor". I COMPLETELY bombed it no idea what I said but it was something stupid. I'm not sure but from that point I gave up on the hopes of being a project manager. 
 
I never researched any other careers for some reason. After graduating I received a full time offer from my internship at Gannett. I was a sales representative and did really great, set some records, and from there I thought sales was for me. I did not enjoy the product we offered plenty of accounts cancelled and that wasn't right. From there, I jumped around many other positions. In that time I learned how to optimize website other wise known as Search Engine Optimization. I took that a step further teaching myself new tactics and enrolling in a certificate program. I tried to start my own consulting business but it was tough having to educate a lot of people and old school business owners just not believing in the product. From there, I had an opportunity to work for some agencies but at the end of the day I didn't see myself having a "full career" 20..30 years doing search engine optimization. I also learned a little bit of wordpress and the basics of uploading websites to servers and what not. 
 
Most of what I learned wasn't from college and I spent a ton on ASU. I had some hard skills but felt like it wasn't enough. I've always had an interest in software development but it was a bit intimidating for me and up until the last 3-5 years there weren't too many bootcamps or I just didn't have any idea about them. Now i'm in the perfect position to take a bit of time off and redeem my college career. Learn a life long skill that I can have a great, flexible, rewarding career. I love the idea of solving problems and building products. 
 
Upon graduation I want to work as a full stack developer so I can continue my learning from industry leaders and gain real world experience. I have some ideas from some small basic applications and I love the idea of building things for people. Now I always have friends who think I know how to code but I don't just yet. 
 
I'm excited for the opportunity to learn with the Flatiron School and for the possibilities for years to come.
